		Journal Entry #1:
		So far in comp sci this year, I feel like I've learned many new coding tecniques and phrases. I'm still having some trouble remembering everything that we've learned, such as where to put divs or how to structure things, but I think I'm getting better at it.

	<div id="journal2">
		Journal Entry #2: I'm starting to understand everything a bit better. I know how to make a pretty basic website and that's basically it. I'm learning how to insert images and just making my website look nicer.
